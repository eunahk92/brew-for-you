# brew-for-you

This is an application that is your one stop shop for all things breweries.

Our application allows a user to search through multiple cities in the United States, and then presents the user with a list of breweries in the city searched.  Allowing them to see the address, contact phone number, website, and the pinned location of the brewery selected from the list. Users can check in and save their visit to the brewery, or add it to their list of favorites, or save that brewery to visit later.
